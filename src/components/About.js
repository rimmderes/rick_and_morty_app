        <p>
Rick and Morty is the Emmy award-winning half-hour animated hit comedy series on Adult Swim that follows a sociopathic genius scientist who drags his inherently timid grandson on insanely dangerous adventures across the universe.</p>

        <hr/>

        <p>It's hard to imagine a show as complex, vast, and emotionally raw as Adult Swim's Rick and Morty. Whether it's hearing stories about how smart and hysterical it is or odd stories about Szechuan sauce and catchphrases like "wubba lubba dub dub," there's a lot to jump on board with from the get-go.Â </p>
